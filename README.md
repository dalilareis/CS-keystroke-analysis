# Keystroke and Emotion Analysis

This project analyses keystroke input and associated emotions. Keystrokes were captured using the project **HookLib**. 
The generated .txt file is then used to extract relevant features. Various statistics are then calculated from these features. 
The text's associated emotions were based on the **EmoLex**. 

This system is able to relate emotions to writing patterns.
