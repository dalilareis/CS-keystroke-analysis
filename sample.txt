Research into context-aware application development actually pre-dates the vision of Ambient Intelligence and, since its introduction as a particular domain of information systems, many advances in modelling and management of contextual information have been put forth by the research community. 
Besides the existing academic interest, there is an observable growth of industry engagement into the Ambient Intelligence application development scene. 
The most notable examples of this trend are in activity areas such as home monitoring and automation, smart city sensing and monitoring infrastructures or Internet-of-Things related scenarios.
